SDM 2.0 records the global incidence of violent and nonviolent self-determination movements, 1945-2020.

The Map function allows you to see the territories that are claimed by self-determination movements, the periods in which they have been active, the type of claim made by self-determination movements, and whether or not they have been involved in armed conflict with the state.

The About section contains additional details on the dataset, how it has been collected, and how it has been funded.
